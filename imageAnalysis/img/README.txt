Noise expands the response range of the Bacillus subtilis competence circuit
Andrew Mugler*, Mark Kittisopikul*, Luke Hayden, Jintao Liu, Chris H. Wiggins, Gurol M. Suel and Aleksandra M. Walczak

Images of the Bacillus subtilis "native" strain are located in the "native" folder and images of the "SynExSlow" strain are found in the "synex" folder. Within each folder are 16-bit .tif files containing the original raw pixels. Since support for 16-bit data is lacking in consumer-grade desktop software, the corresponding linearly contrast stretched 8-bit pngs have been provided for display purposes only. Additionally, binary masks are provided to identify the cells and areas assessed.

The cfp images were binned 2X via the camera settings so they are 2X smaller in each dimension than the phase contrast images. The phase contrast images are analyzed at 1344x1024 to create a mask. Once the masks have been created they are downsized to 672x512 to match the cfp images.

Images 1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond to 0 nM, 750 nM, 1500 nM, and 3000 nM IPTG concentraitons. The synex folder contains a fifth image of cells after incubating in the microscope for 17 additional hours at 3000 nM IPTG concentrations.
