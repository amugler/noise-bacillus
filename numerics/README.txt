Code to generate all data and plots for Figs 3, 5, S2, S4, S5, and S11

All code is Matlab code. Fluorescence data from experiments is included (*.mat), which some of the code imports.

Running the code is very simple:

- for the main figures, run the data files first (fig*_data*.m), in numerical order, then the plot file (fig*_plot.m)

- before running the supplementary figure plot files, run the fig5 data files, since they use the same data
